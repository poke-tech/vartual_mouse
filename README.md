control your computer mouse with hand gestures using the Virtual Hand-Controlled Mouse app. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe for intuitive, hands-free navigation. Contributions welcome!


Overview
The Virtual Hand-Controlled Mouse is an innovative application that utilizes computer vision technology to allow users to control their computer mouse using hand gestures. This project demonstrates the potential of gesture recognition and offers an intuitive alternative to traditional mouse input methods.


Features
Gesture Recognition: The application captures hand movements in real-time and interprets specific gestures to perform mouse actions such as moving the cursor, clicking, and scrolling.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, the application provides a seamless user experience, allowing users to interact with their computer without needing physical input devices.
Real-Time Processing: The application utilizes advanced image processing techniques to achieve minimal latency, ensuring smooth and responsive control.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Built with portability in mind, the application can be easily adapted for use on various operating systems.


Technologies Used
OpenCV: for image processing and hand tracking.
MediaPipe: To facilitate accurate hand landmark detection.
Python: the primary programming language for developing the application.

Usage
Cursor Movement: Touch the tip of your thumb to the base of your index finger to activate the cursor. When they are separated, the cursor stops moving.
Click Actions:
Right Click: Bring the tip of your index finger close to your thumb.
Left Click: Bring the tip of your middle finger close to your thumb.
Double Click: Move both the index and middle fingers close to the thumb.
